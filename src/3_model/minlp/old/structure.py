# Class that defines model data: ModelData

# Class that defines components common to both problems: (Sets, Parameters, and Variables): ModelComponents

# Class that construct UC sub-problem: Subproblem

# Class that constructs master problem: MasterProblem

# Class that combines components to build the model: Controller

# Class t

# Notes: Combine Builder, 3-tier, Blackboard, and Borg design patterns. Goal is to create two models - one for master
# and one for subproblem
